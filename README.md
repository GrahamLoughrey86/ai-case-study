# Paddling into The Future with Kayak

## Overview and Origin

KAYAK was founded in 2004 as an all encompassing metasearch engine to assist consumers looking for the best prices on travel expenditures. Since then the company’s value has grown to over $2 billion, with annual revenues over $100 million. 

KAYAK founding members are Steve Hafner, Paul M. English, Terrell Jones and Glen Slyngstad. Steve Hafner helped create a similar company in 1999, Orbitz. Paul M. English is a tech mogul and philanthropist who has been involved with the creation of many tech companies and charitable non-profit organizations. Terrel Jones founded Travelocity in 1996. Greg Slyngstad founded Expedia Travel in 1996. Quite literally a super team of creators in a similar field. 

The website launched in 2005 and not long after they acquired funding from multiple investment groups. In 2012 KAYAK went public, with their initial stock price increasing over 20% in their first day of trading. In 2013 Bookings Holdings Inc acquired Kayak at the previously mentioned value of $2.1 Billion. As of May 2024 Bookings Holdings Inc stock trades around $3,800 a share. Add that to your portfolio if possible!

## Business Activities

Kayaks mission statement reads, “KAYAK's core mission is centered around simplifying the travel planning process and providing users with the best possible options for their journey.”. Incorporating a number of metasearch engines KAYAK is able to process and determine the best prices for flights and hotels for the average travel consumer. Their utilization of these numerous engines results in them processing 6 billion queries each year. 

Recently KAYAK started utilizing ChatGPT to assist in search queries. Working as a virtual travel assistant, ChatGPT’s language models allow for simpler user input and still receive detailed and personalized advice on their travel plans, prices, and exploration of destinations. 

## Landscape

KAYAK is a conglomeration of metasearch engines with the goal of assisting the consumer in finding the best prices when planning their journey. By taking advantage of their many metasearch engines KAYAK is able to be a leader in the field of travel assistance, advice, and pricing. 

Traveling is a massive part of the global economy from airlines, hotels, restaurants and general commerce. Whether for business or for pleasure, consumers want the best prices when venturing abroad internationally or to a location they regularly visit. Naturally many companies compete in this market. Major competitors to KAYAK include TripAdvisor, Booking.com, Airbnb and Google Flights. 

## Results

KAYAK has evolved into a major tool for small and medium sized companies to assist in travel itineraries for their employees. Since entering the business travel field KAYAK has assisted over 30,000 companies. Streamlining the process for businesses, KAYAK can help with direct payment connections between companies and the airlines. They also are able to determine a flight emissions estimate for businesses. In addition to helping solve these large logistical problems for companies KAYAK also aids in smaller travel details such as being able to determine whether or not your carry on luggage can fit in the overhead bin on specific airlines. All of this information, large or small, helps tremendously making travel easier and thus helping the global economy work more efficiently. 

KAYAK is a major name in the travel industry, from corporate travel to vacationing. They have a solid place in the dynamic travel assistance marketplace. Becoming a go-to source for travel logistics for businesses has made KAYAK a growing and successful company. Annual revenue in 2023 exceeded $120 million, a substantial growth from $82 million in 2020. With the travel market for business or for pleasure growing since the pandemic, KAYAK is in a great position for growth. 
## Recommendations

While offering many quality services to companies and the average travel consumer, like any business, KAYAK can become more dynamic in their offerings. As an outside consumer who enjoys traveling I believe KAYAK can improve on personalized travel itineraries. The way this could be improved is utilizing and incorporating the individual travelers search trends. A personal example for individualized searches would be when I reach a new destination I enjoy a comforting pizza when I reach my hotel. KAYAK could offer an option based on my flights’ arrival time and hotel check-in time I’m given the best options for ordering my dinner in my travel itinerary. KAYAK sees my flight is on time, estimates my hotel check-in time, and while I’m busy getting my luggage and transportation from the airport to the hotel I will have scheduled an order and KAYAK automatically places the order creating a desirable time for the food to be delivered. Being able to deal with the hassles of arriving at my destination and not worry about having the comforting pizza waiting fresh for me when I arrive would be fantastic!
